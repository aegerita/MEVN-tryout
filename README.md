# MEVN

## Technologies I learned through this simple project

- axios (to communicate between frontend and backend through links (sort of))
- bootstrap (easy css)
- vue-router (different web pages)
- express (easy mondodb)
- nodemon (refresh node.js every time)
- mongodb (no sql database)
- body-parser (parse http header, so can use req.body)
- cors (XMLHttpRequest - no idea what it does)
- mongoose (mondodb tool, interface, blah blah)
